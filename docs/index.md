# About

This workshop explores interactive human-in-the-loop computational design and fabrication workflows using phone-based augmented reality (AR). A holistic computational design approach will be demonstrated, where constraints such as structural stability, fabrication constraints, and human-robot task distribution are already considered in the design generation. This computational model is linked with an intuitive phone-based AR application enabling fast task distribution linking robotic and manual assembly. This AR interface informs and instructs humans on fabrication tasks and enables them to adjust and align task distribution interactively.

For this, the workshop shows necessary data structures and software workflows connecting the geometric implementation of edge graphs with AR. It introduces Compas XR, a Compas extension package linking Compas and Compas Fab with XR capabilities for the first time. This custom-developed XR environment for mobile AR connects the CAD environment with a robotic fabrication control. It enables bi-directional interaction between the phone-based AR interface and the CAD environment. For this, the workshop combines multiple software environments such as CAD (Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, Compas and Python), robotic fabrication (Compas Fab and Python) with cloud-based servers (Firebase) and phone-based AR (Unity, ARCore and C#).

The demonstrated methods and approaches will be taught and applied by the workshop participants for the design and realization of a 1:1 scale timber structure.
