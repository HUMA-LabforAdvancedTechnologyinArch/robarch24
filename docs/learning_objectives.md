title: Learning Objectives
---

In this workshop, we will explore the concepts of AR-guided assembly, human-robot task distribution and allocation, and novel design tools. We will leverage a set of software tools uncluding Rhino 7, Grasshopper, Compas, Compas XR, Compas FAB and Unity with ARCore and ARKit. A set of prepared sessions will build upon each other towards the ability to develop the proposed interactive fabrication scenario, incorporating real-time robotic fabrication and augmented manual assembly. 

As part of the learning objectives, students will:
* learn the basic concepts of human-robot collaboration,
* understand the basics of Assembly Information Modeling,
* explore workflows for creating XR content to guide assembly routines, 
* understand how to create and prototype robotic assembly workflows, including the design, robotic and human task planning, and simulations,
* be able to reflect on novel collaborative robotic workflow concepts and implement their concepts in smaller groups,
* experimentally validate human-robot collaborative assembly concepts in a full-scale prototype.
