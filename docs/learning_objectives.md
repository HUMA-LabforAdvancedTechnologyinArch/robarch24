title: Learning Objectives
---

A set of prepared sessions will build upon each other towards the ability to develop the proposed interactive fabrication scenario, incorporating real-time robotic fabrication and augmented manual assembly. 

The learning objectives are as follows:
* Students will learn the basic concepts of human-robot collaboration.
* Students will learn the basics of Assembly Information Modeling.
* Students will learn workflows for creating XR content to guide assembly routines. 
* Students will learn to create and prototype robotic assembly workflows, including the design, robotic and human task planning, and simulations.
* Students can individually reflect on novel collaborative robotic workflow concepts and implement their concepts in smaller groups.
* Students will be able to validate their concepts in a full-scale prototype experimentally.
