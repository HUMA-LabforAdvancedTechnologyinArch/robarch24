title: Learning Objectives and Requirements
---

A set of prepared sessions will build upon each other towards the ability to develop the proposed interactive fabrication scenario, incorporating real-time robotic fabrication and augmented manual assembly. 

The learning objectives are as follows:
* Students will learn the basic concepts of human-robot collaboration.
* Students will learn the basics of Assembly Information Modeling.
* Students will learn workflows for creating XR content to guide assembly routines. 
* Students will learn to create and prototype robotic assembly workflows, including the design, robotic and human task planning, and simulations.
* Students can individually reflect on novel collaborative robotic workflow concepts and implement their concepts in smaller groups.
* Students will be able to validate their concepts in a full-scale prototype experimentally.

In this workshop, we will delve into the intricacies of AR assembly, human-robot task distribution and allocation, and novel design tools. We will be leveraging software tools such as Rhino 7, Grasshopper, Compas, Compas XR, Compas FAB and Unity with ARCore and ARKit. Previous knowledge of Unity and UR10e is an advantage but not necessary, as this will be taught in the workshop. Installation instructions for the required software will be provided to workshop participants two weeks before the start of the workshop.
