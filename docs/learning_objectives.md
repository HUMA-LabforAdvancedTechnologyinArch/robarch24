 In this workshop, participants will gain hands-on experience using a custom AR app and two mobile collaborative robot arms, delving into both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

The workshop covers the following topics:
* basic concepts of human-robot collaboration,
* basics of assembly information modelling,
* specific workflows for authoring AR content for assembly routines,
* author and prototype robotic workflows and simulations,
* implementation of novel robotic workflow concepts,
* experimental validation through a full-scale prototype.
